      "backstory": "Leo was a reclusive genius in the field of arcanatechnology, whose greatest work was Orion, a sentient A.I. designed to be the perfect companion and an anchor to the humanity he felt himself losing. This work was put to the ultimate test when a catastrophic failure of his experimental Infernal Core tore a hole in reality, pulling his research wing into a dark, alien dimension.\n\nIn a desperate act of survival, the mortally wounded Leo fused his body with Orion's unfinished chassis. The integration saved his life, and their shared consciousness became a fortress against the horrors of the abyss. They soon discovered a critical flaw in their fused form: while powerful, they could only ever be in one place, doing one thing at a time. This limitation forced them to evolve. They learned to manipulate the Infernal Core's energy, creating a stable tether that allowed them to separate. Leo could step out of Orion, and the suit, now a fully autonomous golem, could act on its own.\n\nThis breakthrough was the key to their escape. They discovered a fleeting reality fissure, but stabilizing it required a complex, multi-stage process that they could only accomplish by working separately. The escape was a calculated risk, but the rift they created was unstable. It tore them from the dark dimension, not returning them home, but casting them adrift into an entirely unknown universe\u2014the world where their story now begins.\n\nThey are now true outlanders on a cosmic scale, possessing technology and knowledge that does not exist in this new reality. With no history and no connections, all they have is each other. Their goal is no longer just escape, but to survive and understand the rules of the strange, new world they now call home.",

The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when you\u2019re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots.

The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what\u2019s shown in the table\u2019s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1&ndash;3.</p>\r\n<p>If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</em></strong> Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Spellcasting Focus.</em></strong> You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.</p>",

This manifested weapon appears in your hand, is your pact weapon, and uses your Charisma modifier for its attack and damage rolls. It disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or if you manifest a different weapon.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Autonomous Mode:</b></li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a bonus action, you can separate from your suit.

It has an Armor Class equal to your own. Any damage the chassis takes is taken by you from your own hit point pool. If the chassis is forced to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonuses.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Tether Fail-Safe</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If the Orion chassis is ever more than 60 feet away from you at any point in time, the tether's fail-safe protocol is automatically triggered. The suit is instantly recalled to your space, and you immediately enter Integrated Mode. This also happens when Leo is incapacitated.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Remote Action:</b> You can act from either your own position or the chassis's position on the battlefield. When you take the Attack action or cast a spell, you can determine if it originates from your space or the chassis's space. You can also command the chassis to move up to 30 feet (no cost).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To compensate for this risk, your abilities in this mode are enhanced:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Coordinated Casting</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: As a </span><b>bonus action</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you can </span><b>gain 1 Core Strain</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to command Orion to cast a spell you know </span><b>without expending a spell slot</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The spell is cast at its lowest possible level.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Upcasting Option: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you use this feature, you can choose to gain </span><b>1 additional Core Strain</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (for a total of 2).

The item can be any simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a tool, or any piece of adventuring gear. Once this analysis is complete, Orion permanently stores that item's blueprint in its Known Blueprints.</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Equipment Manifestation</b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a bonus action, you can have Orion manifest a perfect, non-magical copy of any item for which you have a blueprint in your current list of </span><b>Stored Blueprints</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This item appears in your empty hand or on the ground in your space. The manifested item has the following properties:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The manifested item is sustained by your psychic link to Orion. It disappears if it is ever outside the range of your psychic tether for more than 1 minute, or if you manifest a different item. You can also dismiss the item at any time (no action required).</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Metaphysical Transience:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Manifested items are a temporary projection of matter sustained by the Infernal Core. They register as non-magical but have no monetary value and cannot be sold. They turn to harmless ash if a transaction involving them is completed.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Replication Protocol:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can manifest one item as part of this bonus action at no extra cost. You can choose to manifest additional, identical copies of that same item as part of the same bonus action, but you must gain </span><b>1 Core Strain</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for each additional item you create.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the manifested item is a weapon, it is considered your pact weapon and uses your Charisma modifier for its attack and damage rolls.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the manifested weapon has the Ammunition property, it magically produces its own ammunition.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Interaction with Magic Items</b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use your analytical abilities to bond with and store existing magic items.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can perform the 1-hour analysis ritual on a magic item to bond with it. Orion integrates the specific item into its systems.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can then dismiss the bonded magic item to an extradimensional space and summon it to your empty hand (or have it appear donned on your person, in the case of armor or clothing) as a bonus action.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Crucially, Orion cannot create magical duplicates of this item; it can only store and summon the original.</b></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a magic item requires attunement, the 1-hour bonding ritual also counts as the time required to attune to the item, using one of your available attunement slots.</span></li>\r\n</ul>",
