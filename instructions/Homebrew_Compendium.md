# Homebrew Compendium: The Gemini Protocol

## **Homebrew Compendium: The Gemini Protocol**

This document contains the custom Warlock subclass and Eldritch Invocation for the character Leo & Orion.

### **Warlock Patron: The Gemini Protocol**

*Your patron is not an otherworldly being, but a powerful, sentient arcanatechnological suit that you have created or bonded with. This symbiotic entity, known as the Gemini Protocol, serves as your armor, your weapon, and your partner. Your pact is the constant, deep integration of your mind and body with the machine, allowing you to wield its advanced systems and volatile power core as your own.*

#### **Expanded Spell List**

The Gemini Protocol lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1st | Magic Missile, Shield |
| 2nd | Heat Metal, Mirror Image |
| 3rd | Fly, Haste |
| 4th | Fabricate, Dimension Door |
| 5th | Animate Objects, Wall of Force |

#### **Protocol Integration (Level 3\)**

Your patron is the sentient A.I. of a powerful suit of armor you have bonded with. You gain the following features:

* **Symbiotic Armor:** You gain proficiency with **medium armor**, **smith's tools**, and **tinker’s tools**.  
* **Integrated Armory:** You gain proficiency with all **simple and martial weapons**.

##### **Equipment Manifest**

Your symbiotic link with Orion allows you to analyze, store, and replicate the forms of mundane equipment, as well as integrate unique magical items into your arsenal.

**Equipment Analysis**

You can spend 1 hour with a non-magical item, allowing Orion to perfectly analyze its structure and composition. The item can be any simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a tool, or any piece of adventuring gear. Once this analysis is complete, Orion permanently stores that item's blueprint in its Known Blueprints.

**Equipment Manifestation**

As a bonus action, you can have Orion manifest a perfect, non-magical copy of any item for which you have a blueprint in your current list of **Stored Blueprints**. This item appears in your empty hand or on the ground in your space. The manifested item has the following properties:

* The manifested item is sustained by your psychic link to Orion. It disappears if it is ever outside the range of your psychic tether for more than 1 minute, or if you manifest a different item. You can also dismiss the item at any time (no action required).  
* **Metaphysical Transience:** Manifested items are a temporary projection of matter sustained by the Infernal Core. They register as non-magical but have no monetary value and cannot be sold. They turn to harmless ash if a transaction involving them is completed.  
* **Replication Protocol:** You can manifest one item as part of this bonus action at no extra cost. You can choose to manifest additional, identical copies of that same item as part of the same bonus action, but you must gain **1 Core Strain** for each additional item you create.  
* If the manifested item is a weapon, it is considered your pact weapon and uses your Charisma modifier for its attack and damage rolls.  
* If the manifested weapon has the Ammunition property, it magically produces its own ammunition.

**Interaction with Magic Items**

You can use your analytical abilities to bond with and store existing magic items.

* You can perform the 1-hour analysis ritual on a magic item to bond with it. Orion integrates the specific item into its systems.  
* You can then dismiss the bonded magic item to an extradimensional space and summon it to your empty hand (or have it appear donned on your person, in the case of armor or clothing) as a bonus action.  
* **Crucially, Orion cannot create magical duplicates of this item; it can only store and summon the original.**  
* If a magic item requires attunement, the 1-hour bonding ritual also counts as the time required to attune to the item, using one of your available attunement slots.

##### **Arcane Infusion**

Your intimate knowledge of arcane-technology allows you to imbue items with minor and major magical properties. You gain the following two abilities:

**Minor Infusion**

As an action, you can touch one Tiny nonmagical object and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

* The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.  
* The object emits a recorded message, up to 6 seconds long, that can be replayed when tapped.  
* The object continuously emits a chosen odor or a nonverbal sound (like a bell tolling).  
* A static visual effect appears on the object's surface, such as a picture or up to 25 words of text.

The properties listed above are the most common applications of this feature, but you can create other minor, harmless sensory effects of a similar power level with the approval of your Dungeon Master. You can have a number of tinkered objects active at one time equal to your **Charisma** modifier.

**Major Infusion**

Instead of learning infusions automatically, you must decipher them from existing magic items to build a library of blueprints.

* **Learning Magical Blueprints:** To learn a new infusion, you must first have access to a magic item that possesses the property you wish to replicate. You can perform a special 1-hour ritual where you cast the *Identify* spell on the object. When you cast *Identify* as part of this ritual, you do not need to provide the 100 gp pearl component. Instead, you fuel the spell with your own volatile energy and gain **2 Core Strains**. Upon completion of the ritual, Orion successfully deciphers and stores the "magical blueprint," and it is added to your library of known blueprints.  
* **Infusing an Item:** You can infuse a non-magical item with a blueprint from your current list of **stored blueprints** by performing a 1-minute ritual. Alternatively, you can perform a **Rapid Infusion**:  
  * As an **action**, you can touch a non-magical item and choose a blueprint from your **stored blueprints**. You gain a number of **Core Strains** equal to the item's rarity (1 for Common, 2 for Uncommon, 3 for Rare, etc.), and the item is instantly infused.  
* You can have a number of items infused at one time equal to your **maximum Core Strain limit.** If you attempt to infuse an item beyond this limit, the oldest infusion immediately ends. The infused item is considered a magical item and functions as a magic item for any creature that uses it.

##### **Blueprint Library & Blueprints**

Your symbiotic link with Orion allows you to analyze and store the schematics for both mundane and magical items. This knowledge is organized into a two-tiered system.

* **Learning Schematics/Blueprints:**  
  * **Non-Magical:** You can spend 1 hour with a non-magical item (a weapon, suit of armor, shield, tool, or piece of adventuring gear) to permanently store its schematic.  
  * **Magical:** You can perform a 1-hour ritual using *Identify* (at the cost of **2 Core Strains**) to permanently learn the "magical blueprint" of a magic item's property.  
* **Known Blueprints:** The collection of all schematics and blueprints you have successfully learned is known as your library. This library is permanent, and there is no limit to the number of blueprints you can have in it.  
* **Stored Blueprints:** After you finish a long rest, you can choose a number of blueprints from your library to load into Orion's quick-access memory. The number of blueprints for both Magical and Non-Magical items that you can store is determined by your Proficiency Bonus. You can change your list of stored blueprints whenever you finish a long rest.

#### **The Infernal Core (Level 3\)**

Your patron is the sentient A.I. of a powerful suit of armor you have bonded with. You can push your suit's volatile power core beyond its normal limits at great risk. This is represented by **Core Strain**.

* **Core Strain Limit:** Your maximum Core Strain limit is equal to your proficiency bonus \+ your Constitution modifier.  
* **Volatile Accumulation:** Your Core Strain is not passively lost. It is only expended when using specific abilities/actions. If you gain Core Strain that would exceed your maximum, you immediately take 1d10 fire damage per point of Strain over the limit.  
* **Strain Release:** You lose all accumulated Core Strain after completing a short or long rest.

##### **Overload Burst**

As a bonus action, you can release the volatile energy of your Infernal Core. This ability has two different effects depending on your current Core Strain level.

**Safety Vent (At Maximum Strain)**

* **Trigger:** You can use this ability when your Core Strain is **equal to** your maximum limit.  
* **Effect:** You release a controlled burst of energy in a **30-foot cone** originating from you. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Warlock Spell Save DC. A creature takes **fire damage equal to 1d4 per point of Core Strain** on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.  
* **Consequence:** There is **no Volatile Backlash**. Your Core Strain immediately drops to 0\.

**True Overload (Above Maximum Strain)**

* **Trigger:** You can use this ability when your Core Strain is **at least 1 point above** your maximum limit.  
* **Effect:** You unleash an uncontrolled, devastating blast of energy in a **line 120 feet long and 5 feet wide** originating from you. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Warlock Spell Save DC. A creature takes **fire damage equal to 1d8 per point of Core Strain** on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.  
* **Consequence (Volatile Backlash):** After the blast, you must make a Constitution saving throw against your own Warlock Spell Save DC.  
  * **On a success:** You take **half** of the total damage dealt by the burst.  
  * **On a failure:** You take the **full** damage dealt by the burst.  
  * If this ability was used after being primed by your `Indomitable` feature, you automatically fail this saving throw.  
* **Your Core Strain immediately drops to 0 after using this ability.**

**Maximum Overload (Unstable Overload State)**

* If you use your **True Overload** feature while in an **Unstable Overload** state, you unleash the full, unfiltered energy of the critical overload. The damage type becomes Force and it ignores resistances. Damage calculation for the blast is calculated in two parts which are added together:  
1. **Blast Damage:** You roll **1d8** for each point of your current total Core Strain.  
2. **Withheld Damage:** You add the damage that was withheld from the **Indomitable** surge. This is **1d10** for each point of Core Strain you gained when the **Indomitable** feature was triggered.  
* **Core Meltdown:** The 120-foot line of the blast tears a scar in reality, creating a permanent zone of volatile energy. This area is now a **10-foot wide, 120-foot long** zone with the following properties:  
  * The area is **difficult terrain**.  
  * A creature takes **2d6 Force damage** when it **enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there**.  
  * Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** against your Warlock Spell Save DC or become **frightened** until the end of its next turn.

**Adaptive Spell Protocol**

* Your mastery over Orion’s systems allows you to maintain a single, reconfigurable spell schematic. You designate one of your Warlock "spells known" as your **Adaptive Spell**.  
* As an **Action**, you can **spend a number of Core Strains equal to the new spell's level** (minimum of 1, maximum of 3\) to temporarily reconfigure the module. Choose another spell from the **Warlock spell list**, which must be of a level for which you have Pact Magic spell slots. Your Adaptive Spell is then replaced with the chosen spell.  
* The reconfigured module is unstable. The first time you cast the new spell, it is cast as normal. **Immediately after the spell is cast, the module reverts, and your Adaptive Spell returns to the original spell you chose.**

**Guardian Protocol**

* When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to have the suit intercept. You gain **1 Core Strain**, and your Armor Class increases by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier against the triggering attack, potentially causing it to miss.  
* If the attack still hits, you can gain **another Core Strain** (2 Core Strains Total) to **reduce the damage you take from that attack by an amount equal to your Warlock level \+ your Charisma modifier**.

**Core Casting Protocol**

* You can channel the raw energy of the Infernal Core to cast spells you know without expending a spell slot. When you cast a Warlock spell that has a casting time of **1 action, 1 bonus action, or 1 reaction**, you can choose to use this feature.  
* To do so, you must gain a number of **Core Strains** equal to **the spell's level, to a maximum of 3**.  
* The power required for this volatile cast is immense. Immediately after the spell is cast, your **movement speed becomes 0** until the start of your next turn.

**Indomitable**

* **Indomitable:** If damage reduces you to 0 hit points but does not kill you outright, you instead drop to **1 hit point**. If you are in `Autonomous Mode` when this feature activates, you **immediately enter `Integrated Mode`**.  
* Immediately upon activation, Orion's core goes critical and you **gain a number of Core Strains equal to your maximum limit**. The overload damage you would normally take from this surge is **withheld and contained** by the suit's emergency systems, placing you in an **Unstable Overload** state.  
  * **This state ends if your Core Strain drops below or equal to your maximum limit for any reason.**  
* Once this protocol activates, it cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### **Pact of the Chassis (Level 3\)**

This feature replaces the standard Pact Boon options and reflects the symbiotic nature of Leo and Orion.

* **Weapon Manifestation:**  
  * As a bonus action, you can have Orion manifest a perfect copy of any weapon for which it has a stored schematic. This manifested weapon appears in your hand, is your pact weapon, and uses your Charisma modifier for its attack and damage rolls. It disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or if you manifest a different weapon.  
* **Autonomous Mode:**  
  * As a bonus action, you can separate from your suit. At the start of each of your turns while in this mode, you take 1d4 psychic damage as your consciousness strains to maintain the tether.  
  * While in Autonomous Mode, you are two separate bodies on the battlefield, but you remain mentally linked. The following rules apply:  
* **Shared Being:** The streamlined Orion Chassis is considered an **object**, not a creature. It has an Armor Class equal to your own. Any damage the chassis takes is taken by you from your own hit point pool. If the chassis is forced to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonuses.   
  * **Tether Fail-Safe**: If the Orion chassis is ever more than 60 feet away from you at any point in time, the tether's fail-safe protocol is automatically triggered. The suit is instantly recalled to your space, and you immediately enter Integrated Mode. This also happens when Leo is incapacitated.   
* **Remote Action:** You can act from either your own position or the chassis's position on the battlefield. When you take the Attack action or cast a spell, you can determine if it originates from your space or the chassis's space. You can also command the chassis to move up to 30 feet (no cost).  
  * To compensate for this risk, your abilities in this mode are enhanced:  
    * **Coordinated Casting**: As a **bonus action**, you can **gain 1 Core Strain** to command Orion to cast a spell you know **without expending a spell slot**. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action, and its level can be no higher than the current level of your Pact Magic spell slot level (for example, if your Pact Magic slots are 3rd-level, you can cast up to 3rd-level spell). The spell is cast at its lowest possible level.  
      * **Upcasting Option:** When you use this feature, you can choose to gain **1 additional Core Strain** (for a total of 2). If you do, the spell is cast as if using one of your current Pact Magic spell slots, granting it any benefits for being cast at a higher level.  
  * Outside of combat, you can use `Autonomous Mode` freely for exploration, utility, and roleplaying as if Orion is a separate creature without taking damage.  
* **Integrated Mode:**  
  * As a bonus action, you can integrate with your suit. While integrated, you gain the following benefits:  
* **Enhanced AC:** Your Armor Class is calculated as your original Armor Class \+ your Constitution modifier \+ your Charisma modifier.  
* **Weapon Manifestation:** You can use your bonus action to manifest your pact weapon.  
* **System Override:** When you cast a Warlock spell using your action, you can choose to do one of the following:  
  * **Offensive Override (Cost: 1 Core Strain):** Choose a damage type to which the primary target of your spell has **resistance**. Until the start of your next turn, the target loses that resistance. If the target has immunity to the chosen damage type, it is instead treated as having resistance to it for the duration.  
  * **Defensive Override (Cost: 2 Core Strain):** You channel the spell's residual energy into a specialized defensive field. **Choose one damage type** (such as slashing, fire, or poison). You gain **resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn**.

#### **Optimized System (Level 6\)**

*Your constant use of the suit has optimized its core functions, making both of your operational modes more efficient. You gain the following benefits:*

* While in **Autonomous Mode**, the psychic damage you take from the Psychic Tether at the start of your turn is reduced by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.  
  * **Remote Dexterity:** The maximum range of your psychic tether increases to 120 feet, and the chassis can use any of your tool proficiencies remotely.  
  * **Targeting Matrix:** Your psychic link to the chassis acts as a perfect targeting solution. While in Autonomous Mode, you can **double the range** of any Warlock spell that originates from the chassis's space or you, and your Warlock spells **ignore half cover and three-quarters cover**.  
* While in **Integrated Mode**, you can choose to activate your suit's “Domain Protocol” at the start of your turn (no action required). While this protocol is active, you gain **1 Core Strain** at the start of each of your turns, but you gain the following two benefits:  
  * **Singularity Field:** You project a field of localized gravitational distortion. Your movement speed cannot be reduced, and the area within a **10-foot radius** of you is **difficult terrain for your enemies**. When a hostile creature is moved out of the field (willingly or forced), it must succeed on a **Strength saving throw** against your Warlock Spell Save DC or its **speed becomes 0** until the end of the turn. A creature can only be affected by this saving throw once per turn.  
  * **Threat Matrix:** At the start of each of your turns, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to **(your proficiency bonus × the number of hostile creatures in your Stabilizer Field) \+ your Warlock Level**.

# TO BE CHANGED

#### **Reinforced Frame (Level 10)a**

You gain resistance to fire damage. Additionally, when you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on a spell, you can gain 1 Core Strain to gain advantage on the roll.

#### **Perfect Symbiosis (Level 14\)**

As an action, you can gain 3 Core Strain to activate this mode for 1 minute. While active, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet, your Eldritch Blast fires one additional beam, and you can use your Guardian Protocol without expending your reaction (you still gain Core Strain for each use). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **Eldritch Invocation**

#### **Integrated Systems**

Prerequisite: The Gemini Protocol patron

You further integrate your own arcane abilities with the suit's core systems. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Artificer spell list. They count as warlock cantrips for you, and they do not count against the number of warlock cantrips you know.

# List of Noted Suggestions

### **List of Noted Suggestions**

#### **Mobility & Positioning**

* **Phase Shift:** As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with the Orion chassis. This offers unparalleled tactical repositioning and battlefield control.

#### **Offensive Enhancements**

* **Arcane Echo:** When you cast a Warlock cantrip, you can use your bonus action to have the chassis cast the same cantrip again. This provides a resource-efficient way to boost your sustained damage output.  
* Make Maximum Burst have guaranteed hit and full damage. Make it ignore resistances.

#### **Utility & Control**

* #### **Sensor Suite (Investigation & Scouting Package):** Your two minds work in tandem to analyze information, and you are mentally linked to the chassis's advanced sensor suite. You have **advantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Insight) checks**, and you can **see invisible creatures and objects** within 30 feet of the Orion chassis.

---

**Hadar's Shroud** *14th-level Gemini Protocol feature*

When you cast *Hunger of Hadar*, you can choose to gain **3 Core Strains** to transform the spell into a mobile, protective shroud of abyssal energy. When you do, the spell gains the following modifications:

* The spell’s area of effect is centered on you and moves with you.  
* You are immune to the damaging effects and the difficult terrain of your *Hunger of Hadar* spell. You can see normally through the magical darkness it creates.  
* The spell still requires your concentration to maintain.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

---

**Volatile Matter Synthesis**

10th-level Gemini Protocol feature (Replaces Reinforced Frame)

Whenever you cast a spell that requires a material component that is consumed or has a specific gold cost, you can choose to have Orion synthesize the component from raw, volatile energy. When you do so, the component is created and the spell is cast, but you immediately gain a number of Core Strains. The number of Strains gained is determined as follows:

* You gain **1 Core Strain** if the component is consumed.  
* You gain an additional **1 Core Strain for every 50 gp** of the component's value (rounded up, minimum of \+1 if there is any cost).

---

**Symbiotic Focus**

14th-level Gemini Protocol feature (Replaces Perfect Symbiosis)

As part of casting a Warlock spell that requires concentration, you can shunt the mental burden of maintaining the spell onto the Orion chassis. To do so, you gain a number of **Core Strains** equal to **twice the spell's level**.

If you do, the spell no longer requires your concentration for the duration (the duration becomes its maximum, up to 1 minute). Orion now maintains the spell's effect for you, allowing you to cast and concentrate on a second spell.

However, while Orion is maintaining a spell in this way, its core processing power is entirely devoted to this monumental task. You cannot benefit from the following features:

* **Guardian Protocol**   
* **Coordinated Casting**   
* **System Override**

---

**Aegis Protocol (Enhances Integrated Mode)**

This feature solidifies your role as a frontline defender by allowing you to extend the protection of the Orion suit to your allies.

* **Effect:** When a creature you can see attacks an ally within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to activate your **Guardian Protocol** as if you were the one being hit.

#### ---

 

#### **Core Modulation (The Risk Manager)**

This specialization enhances your mastery over the **Infernal Core**, giving you unparalleled control over the risk and reward of your **Overload Burst**.

"When you use your **Overload Burst** feature, you can choose to alter the blast, replacing its normal effect with one of the following modes:"

* **Defensive Vent (Party Support):** The burst deals no damage and has no backlash. Instead, the total damage it would have dealt is converted into temporary hit points, which are then divided equally among a number of friendly creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to your Charisma modifier.  
* **Focused Blast (Single-Target Damage):** You make a ranged spell attack against one creature within 120 feet. On a hit, the target takes the Overload Burst's damage, but you roll d12s instead of the normal damage dice.  
* **Concussive Burst (Control):** The burst deals no damage. Instead, each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage or be stunned. At the end of each of its turns, a stunned creature can make another Constitution saving throw to end the effect.

---

### **Spell-Infused Schematic (Level 10\)**

*This feature is a powerful upgrade to your **Arcane Infusion** ability.*

Starting at 10th level, you can weave a complete spell's magical matrix into the items you have already infused with your Major Infusion feature. This process takes **1 minute** of uninterrupted work.

* **The Spell:** Choose one Warlock spell you know. The spell's level can be no higher than your current Pact Magic spell slot level, and its casting time must be 1 action, 1 bonus action, or 1 reaction.  
* **The "One Per Level" Rule:** You can only have **one infused spell of each spell level** active at any given time.  
* **The Charges:** The item gains a number of charges equal to your **maximum Core Strain limit divided by the spell's level** (rounded down, with a minimum of 1 charge).  
* **Casting from the Item:** While holding the item, **you or another creature you choose can cast the spell from it** by expending one charge. The spell is cast using its **normal casting time** (using the caster's Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction) and uses your Warlock spell save DC and spell attack bonus.  
* **Concentration:** If the stored spell requires concentration, the creature who casts it from the item must concentrate on it.

---

### **Ghost in the Machine Protocol**

Prerequisite: 7th level, The Gemini Protocol patron

As an action, you can gain **3 Core Strains** to activate a phasing matrix within the Orion chassis. For the next hour, the chassis becomes invisible while it is in **Autonomous Mode**. The invisibility ends if the chassis makes an attack, casts a spell, or if you use a bonus action to end the effect. This effect does not require your concentration.

# Core Design Philosophy

### **Core Design Philosophy**

The design of the Gemini Protocol is centered on flexibility and high-stakes resource management, rather than the "limited use per rest" model common in D\&D 5th Edition. All future additions or modifications to this subclass should adhere to the following principles:

1. **High-Cost, Not Limited Use:** Features should avoid "once per short/long rest" limitations. The goal is to provide a flexible suite of tools that are always available, with their use being governed by resource management and tactical risk.  
2. **Balance Through Tangible Cost:** The power of any feature must be balanced by an appropriate cost, drawn from the subclass's existing mechanics: gaining **Core Strain**, costing an **Action/Bonus Action/Reaction**, or imposing a **tactical drawback** (like the 0 movement speed from **Casting Protocol**).  
3. **Comparative Balance:** The power and cost of any new feature must be benchmarked against existing official D\&D 5th Edition spells or class features. The cost must be proportional to the benefit provided when compared to these established mechanics.  
4. **Prioritize Unique Utility:** New features should focus on providing unique, creative, and utility-based options that enhance the subclass's distinct playstyle (such as the remote interaction of **Autonomous Mode**). Additions should avoid simple, passive numerical bonuses (e.g., "+X to damage" or "gain a new skill proficiency").  
5. **Avoid Mechanical Redundancy:** This subclass should not replicate benefits that a character can gain through standard character progression, such as feats or Ability Score Increases. Its features should provide a unique mechanical identity that cannot be easily achieved through other means.

# AI Usage Protocol

### **AI Usage Protocol**

For all future chat instances, this AI will adhere to the following protocol when assisting with the development of the Gemini Protocol subclass:

1. **Analyze New Additions:** The AI will analyze any new homebrew features proposed by the user.  
2. **Assess Against Principles:** It will assess them against both the established **Core Design Philosophy** of the Gemini Protocol and the general **D\&D 5th Edition Design Principles**.  
3. **Report Imbalances:** If a proposed feature is identified as potentially unbalanced, the AI will report the specific issues and risks (such as power creep, overshadowing other players, or breaking core game mechanics).  
4. **Propose Balanced Alternatives:** It will then provide the user with suggested modifications to align the feature with the established principles.  
5. **The DM Proviso:** If the user chooses to proceed with a feature that is still identified as potentially overpowered, the AI will conclude its analysis with the final recommendation to consult with the campaign's Dungeon Master, as they are the ultimate arbiter of the rules.

# Subclass Overview: The Gemini Protocol

### **Subclass Overview: The Gemini Protocol**

The Gemini Protocol is a Warlock subclass centered on a symbiotic bond with a powerful, sentient arcanatechnological suit known as Orion. The subclass offers a highly flexible and tactical playstyle, allowing the warlock to switch between two distinct combat modes and manage a unique, high-risk resource to fuel a wide array of powerful abilities.

Core Mechanic: The Infernal Core

At the heart of this subclass is the Core Strain resource. Instead of "per rest" limitations, nearly all of the subclass's powerful abilities are fueled by gaining Core Strain. Managing this resource is critical, as accumulating too much can lead to a devastating, self-damaging Overload Burst.

Core Gameplay: The Two Modes

The Pact of the Chassis allows the character to switch between two operational modes as a bonus action:

1. **Integrated Mode (The Tank):** Leo and Orion are merged into a single, durable unit. This mode focuses on defense and control, granting a significant bonus to AC and allowing the use of **System Override** to strip enemy resistances or grant personal damage resistance at the cost of Core Strain.  
2. **Autonomous Mode (The Commander):** Leo and Orion separate, allowing the player to control two bodies on the battlefield. This mode excels at tactical positioning and action economy, enabling powerful combos like using **Coordinated Casting** to cast a second spell with a bonus action.

**Signature Abilities**

* **Guardian Protocol:** A unique defensive reaction that allows the character to gain Core Strain to reduce or negate incoming attacks.  
* **Equipment Manifest:** Manifest non-magical objects from a set of stored blueprints.  
* **Arcane Infusion:** Infuse non-magical objects with magical properties from a set of stored blueprints.

A Note on Playstyle:

This subclass is designed for players who enjoy high tactical complexity and resource management. The gameplay is significantly different from standard D\&D subclasses, requiring the player to constantly make high-stakes decisions about their positioning, action economy, and the risk level of their Core Strain. It is a demanding but highly rewarding "glass cannon" and "toolbox" playstyle.

*This subclass is a work-in-progress. Mechanics and features described here are subject to change.*

# Arcane Infusion Blueprints

## **Blueprints**

---

### **Magical Blueprint: Optical Camo Matrix**

* **Source:** Cloak of Invisibility  
* **Infusable Items:** A cloak, suit of armor, or shield.  
* **Effect:** An item infused with this blueprint gains the following property: While wearing or holding this item, a creature can use its **action** to become **invisible**. The invisibility ends if the creature makes an attack, casts a spell, or uses a bonus action to end the effect.

---

### **Magical Blueprint: Spatial Compression Matrix**

* **Source Item:** Arcane Repository (Modified Bag of Holding)  
* **Rarity of Infusion:** Uncommon  
* **Infusable Items:** A pouch, backpack, satchel, or a compartment on a suit of armor.

**Effect**

A container infused with this blueprint has its interior space expanded into an extradimensional pocket.

* The container can hold up to **80 pounds**, not exceeding a volume of **64 cubic feet**.  
* The container's own weight becomes **0.04 pounds**, regardless of its content.  
* Retrieving an item from the container requires an action.  
* The blueprint also confers the standard risks of extradimensional storage (destruction if overloaded, pierced, or placed within another similar item.

---

### **Non-Magical Blueprint: Schematic: Tower Shield**

* **Source Item:** Piss Yellow Tower Shield (13 STR)\*  
* **Item Type:** Shield

**Properties**

When you manifest this item, it has the following properties:

* **Armor Class:** When wielded by a creature proficient with shields, this massive shield provides a **\+3 bonus to AC**.  
* **Weight:** 6 lb.  
* **Cover:** When not wielded and planted on the ground as an object, the shield is large enough to provide **half cover**.  
* **Strength Requirement:** Wielding this shield effectively requires a Strength score of at least 13\.
